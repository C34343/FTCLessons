## Introduction To Programming
1. Have everyone go to **learnjavaonline.org** and click on the **Hello, World!** lesson  
&nbsp;  
2. Talk about why you would code  
    * Everything is made using code
    * Really good jobs
    * Can mix with other skills (E.X. coding musicians making music apps) 
    * It can change the way you think
    * Stories about how coding has changed your life  
&nbsp;  
3. Talk about why we are using Java
    * FTC only has Java and block coding
    * Gives more understanding and skills
    * Prepares you better for the future
    * Most FRC teams use Java, so it prepares you for high school  
&nbsp;  
4. Talk about how Java is an Object Oriented Language (We don't expect them to understand this until they have more experience)
    * Everything is treated as an object that stores data
    * Works well with Robots because all the technology on the robot is it's own object
    * In an object we can create functions, which hold instructions that we can use by calling the method

5. Start Working through the lesson that you opened earlier, explaining the code line by line. (Teach them to read the code like it's english.)  
&nbsp;  
6. When we reach the bottom, start the lesson and run the code without changing anything  
&nbsp;  
7. Instead of fixing the problem, create more and teach them how to read the error messages. (Change some things outside of the quotes, make sure to show that it's case sensitive)  
&nbsp;  
8. Once you are done creating and fixing problems in the code, solve the exercise and move on to the next lesson
