## Variables and Types
1. Have everyone go to **learnjavaonline.org** and click on the **Variables and Types** lesson  
&nbsp;
2. Start by explaining what a variable is  
&nbsp;
3. Then go over each type we will be using this season
    * int (Used for distances and other whole numbers)
    * double (Used for motor/servo power and other decimal numbers)
    * boolean (Used for a ton, checking if a button is pressed, almost all systems on the robot will be using a boolean)
    * String (Used for telemetry, which is output of data from the robot)  
&nbsp;
4. Show how to delcare, assign, and reassign variables (You can ignore type casting)  
&nbsp;
5. Talk about Concating to strings  
&nbsp;
6. Start the exercise by writing **H3110_w0r1d_2.0_true** on a board, and getting the students to break down what parts they can assign to what types of variables. While you could put them all in a string, you want them to use at least one of each of the types previously talked about to get them used to using variable types. (I'd highly recommend putting the space in a string by itself, so they can reuse a variable. Some people don't come to that conclusion themselves, so showing them is the best course of action)  
&nbsp;
7. Once you have that done, you can start writing the code in the exercise, go one variable at a time, and concat them all together into a result string and print that string out  
&nbsp;
8. When you have all the types made and completed the exercise move on to the next lesson
