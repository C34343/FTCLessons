## Conditionals
**Let me preface this lesson by saying that we don't expect most of them to understand this lesson until they have more programming background, It is a hard concept to understand with little background knowledge**  
&nbsp;  
1. Have everyone go to **learnjavaonline.org** and click on the **Conditionals** lesson  
&nbsp;
2. Start with a recap about the variables and types, and put some focus on booleans  
&nbsp;
3. Explain that conditionals are built in functions that compare two variables and return true or false, and there are two main types. Conditionals that compare numbers, and Conditionals that compare booleans.  
&nbsp;
4. (Note to self: Write about Numerical Conditionals then Boolean Conditionals)
