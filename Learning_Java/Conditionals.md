## Conditionals
**Let me preface this lesson by saying that we don't expect most of them to understand this lesson until they have more programming background, It is a hard concept to understand with little background knowledge**  
&nbsp;  
1. Have everyone go to **learnjavaonline.org** and click on the **Conditionals** lesson  
&nbsp;
2. Start with a recap about the variables and types, and put some focus on booleans  
&nbsp;
3. Show and talk about if, else if, and else statements, how it accepts a boolean and does something if it true and the order they run  
&nbsp;
4. Explain that conditionals compare two variables and return true or false, and there are two main types. Conditionals that compare numbers, and Conditionals that compare booleans.  
&nbsp;
5. Talk more in detail about the Conditionals that compare numbers, and explain every one (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)  
&nbsp;
6. Talk more in detail about the Conditionals that compare booleans (&&, ||), show the logic table and explain how you remember what each does  
&nbsp;
7. Explain the one conditional that doesn't compare anything, the logical not (!)  
&nbsp;
8. Ignore the rest of the lesson, and go straight to the exercise but we want to change the exercise quite a bit  
&nbsp;
9. Start by changing the four variables into integers, and assign them a value  
&nbsp;
10. Then change the b2 and b3 to **d == b** and **c != a** respectively  
&nbsp;
11. Now you can start by finding more information, We don't know which is correct and which isn't, so lets add an else statement, and have it print what b1, b2, and b3 are  
&nbsp;
12. Now that we know what all the variables are, we can start changing the equations to make them all true. Prefferrably you should have the students figure out what logic to use, but make sure to combine some operators for at least one (E.X. **A > B || A <= B**)  
&nbsp;
13. Once everyone is done with the exercise, you are done learning the java needed and can go onto the next lesson where you can start coding the bot
