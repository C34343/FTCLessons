## FTC Lessons

This Repository conatains all of the programming lessons we are using to teach the members of the Pleasant Lee Middle School, East Trails Middle School, and Holden Middle School's robotics teams.

## How to Use

There will be three files per lesson, a .md file, and two java file. One java file contains the finished code, and one conatins the code you will want to use for the lesson. There are a few exceptions that only have a .md file, and that is because you will not be using Android studio for those lessons.
To start, you will want all of the students to open the lesson java file and copy it into a blank Android Studio file.
From there the instructor should open the .md instructions file, and follow the instructions.
You can reference the finished code if you need, but preferably the students should be able to finish their code without referencing the finished code.
